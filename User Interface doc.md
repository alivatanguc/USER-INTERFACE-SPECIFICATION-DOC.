**USER INTERFACE SPECIFICATION**




1.INTRODUCTION

` `The point of human-computer contact and communication in a device is the user interface (UI). This can include desktop displays, keyboards, mouse, and other pointing devices. It also refers to the manner in which a user engages with a website or application. Many firms now give UI a higher emphasis in an effort to improve the user experience as a result of the rising reliance of many businesses on online and mobile apps. The various types of user interfaces include; graphical user interface (GUI), command line interface (CLI), menu-driven user interface, touch user interfacei voice user interface (VUI), form-based user interface and natural language user interface.

Command Line Interface (CLI)

Many programmers and technical users like CLI over other interfaces. CLI is the bare minimal user interface that a piece of software may offer.

Graphical User Interface 

The user can interact with the system graphically thanks to the graphical user interface. GUIs can combine hardware and software components. The user interprets the software using the GUI.

2.REQUIREMENTS

The user interface ought to be safe, practical, and expandable. The maintenance of customer confidentiality, protection from illegal access to authorisation information, and monitoring of payments in progress are all security requirements. Additionally, the issue of fraud protection for each party needs to be addressed. 

The user interface needs to be quick and simple to use.

In terms of speed and user interaction, the user interface should be effective. User interactions that are not necessary should be avoided. Unnecessary communications cause delays and more potential problems. The goal of any significant processing should be made clear where it is necessary. Processing should, whenever possible, not interfere with the user interface.



The privacy of the customer must be protected. The use of personal data is carefully regulated by law in many areas. Additionally, the Internet's tightly connected communication structure raises the bar for ethical behavior demanded of businesses that use it for commerce.




3.UI COMPONENTS

The most essential elements of a web application are the UI components. They include every design element and element of the program, including text, buttons, input fields, and icons. They serve as the fundamental building elements for all applications. User interface elements are in charge of how the user and the application interact. They help users traverse the application with ease and provide an efficient user experience. Additionally, UI elements aid them in rapidly carrying out a number of tasks, including as adding or modifying data, filtering data, and choosing a date on the calendar.



3.1 Input Elements

Checkbox, the user can choose one or more things from a list using checkboxes. Checkboxes are typically best displayed as a vertical list. If the list is too large to scroll or if a comparison of terms is likely to be essential, more than one column is also appropriate.

Dropdown lists let users choose one item at a time, but they take up less room because they are smaller. To make it easier for the user to understand what has to be done.

Buttons are often labeled with text, an icon, or both to indicate what it will do when clicked.

Text fields, users can enter text into text fields. A single line or several lines of text are also acceptable.





\4. BEHAVIOR OF THE PAGE


There is a part on the login screen for adding new users, where they must choose their username, contact information (including phone and email addresses), and user role. There are three specified user roles, and it is expected that one of them will be chosen. The user is required to tick the "Enabled" button after choosing the user role; after the button is checked, the new user's account is activated. There is a "Save User" button after entering the user's information, and using this button adds the user to the table using the data they submitted. If we look at the table, the user information input determines the "ID" parameter's automatic assignment, and this "ID" parameter is assigned sequentially, for instance, 1, 2, 3, 4. If a new user will be entered after the current user is added to the table, utilize the "New User" button. Users who do not click the "Enabled" button during user input are hidden since "Hide Disabled User" is chosen.
